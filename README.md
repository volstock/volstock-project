## Git Practices for This Project

### General Guidelines
- **Avoid pushing code directly to the `main` branch.** This can lead to untested or incomplete code being deployed.
- **Always work on a separate branch** that is specific to the feature, bug fix, or task you are working on. This keeps the `main` branch clean and stable.

### Steps for a Successful Workflow

1. **Update Local Repository**
   - Ensure your local repository is up-to-date by checking out the latest version of the `main` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```

2. **Create a New Branch**
   - Create a new branch with a descriptive name that indicates the work being done:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b name-of-feature-you-are-developing
     ```

3. **Develop and Commit**
   - Make your changes and commit regularly with clear and informative commit messages:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Brief description of the changes"
     ```

4. **Push the Branch**
   - Push your branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin name-of-feature-you-are-developing
     ```

5. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   - On GitHub navigate to the branch and create a Pull Request (PR).
   - Ensure the PR title and description are clear and provide context for the changes made.

6. **Code Review and Merge**
   - Wait for the code to be reviewed by team members. Address any feedback or requested changes.
     
7. **Clean Up**
   - After the PR is merged, delete the branch both locally and remotely:
     ```bash
     git branch -d name-of-feature-you-are-developing
     git push origin name-of-feature-you-are-developing
  - You can also do it in GitHub
